    <p> Relationship with computer: <strong><em>I have only had this computer for about a month, so far I've enjoyed using it and like it more than my previous computer.</em></strong> <br> Description of performance based on hardware: <strong><em> I have not had this computer for very long, so I can't really speak for its perfromance and hardawre. However it is faster than my previous computer and allows me to have more applications and windows open at the same time, this is mainly due to it possibly having a more powerful CPU and more RAM.</em></strong> </p>
